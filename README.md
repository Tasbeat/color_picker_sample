# Flex ColorPicker Example

A simple example application using the Flex ColorPicker package.

## Getting Started

To see the example on a device or simulator, clone the [flex_color_picker](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_picker.git) repository and run the example:

```bash
cd example/
flutter run --release
```

The result is a basic default picker on the canvas and another picker that opens in a dialog. The dialog version and has a different style with a few more options present.
